# Matix
Matix- Manufacturing Optimization Engine. Optimal Usage of manufacturing lines based on sales orders, backlogs and demand forecast minimizing cost and chances of delay thus producing working factory layout.


### Project Overview
----------------------------------
Factories often find it difficult in managing manufacturing as to control production aiming for minimizing delay and on-time shipment thus reducing backlogs. The provided problem statement lead us to find solutions for optimal usage of manufacturing lines in consideration of Current Orders, Backlogs and Forecasted orders thus minimizing wastage,cost and and delay and maximizing factory output in a well accounted way.
